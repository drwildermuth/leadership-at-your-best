<h1>Escape the Arena</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Hunger Games-themed leadership escape room!
You’ll work individually or in teams to explore Kouzes and Posner’s Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership. Each of the five practices is introduced through two puzzles—ten challenges total.
Some challenges include video clips or artwork inspired by scenes from The Hunger Games. Each includes a multiple-choice question and a required reflection prompt. Note: Some questions may seem to have more than one reasonable answer. Your goal is to choose the best one based on your understanding of effective leadership.
After each correct answer, you’ll receive a clue word in ALL CAPS. Keep track of these! At the end of the activity, you’ll enter all ten clue words to solve the final puzzle.
Once the puzzle is solved, you’ll unlock a downloadable report containing your name, answers, and reflections. Submit that file on Canvas in the designated assignment area. Your reflections are the most important part—take your time with them.</p>
